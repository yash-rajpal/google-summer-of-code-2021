	Apps.BadWords : A Rocket.Chat App for bad words filtration for incoming messages and apply moderation policies.
		</p>
	</b>
</div>

# Abstract
Currently Rocket.Chat supports the bad words filtration of incoming messages in channels but that is not much customizable for the user. The idea for this App is to utilize the capabilities of Rocket.Chat.Apps-Engine and make a Rocket.Chat app which can provide a feature rich experience to the users and people can use the app according to their needs.

## Deliverables

The deliverables of the project are as follows:

- [x] Create a UI for managing the App settings.
- [x] Load a list of words from a URL.
- [x] Add/Remove words from a list.
- [x] Add/Remove channels where the bad words filtering is enabled (with a toggle for "all channels").
- [x] Provide statistics on blocked words and offending users.
- [x] Automatically deactivate users that go above a certain threshold.

All of the listed deliverables were completed within the GSoC period.

The App can be found here - [App on Github](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.BadWords).
